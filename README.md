# My App - Kiro Development Workspace

This is a development workspace managed with Kiro, an AI-powered IDE assistant that helps with spec-driven development.

## Project Structure

- **`.kiro/`** - Kiro configuration and specifications
  - `specs/` - Feature specifications with requirements, design, and task documents
- **`memo-app/`** - React-based memo application
- **`.vscode/`** - VS Code configuration
